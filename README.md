The purpose of this template is to track event view_item into the Exponea platform. A prerequisite for this tracking is to have Exponea initialised on your website with the appropriate token for your project. This is done via the Exponea initialisation script which should be loaded on a website before any Exponea tracking script. 

To use this template, create variables in the Google Tag Manager pointing to relevant values that you wish to track as attributes of the view_item event. 

Then fill in those values into the corresponding fields, which you wish to track as attributes of the view_item event.
